[![TransUnited](public/logo.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

This app will help the thousands of immigrants make the transition to the United States smoother by connecting them to a selection of agents handpicked that can offer them a number of services to assist them with their transfer.  

Services can include translation, helping opening a bank account, finding a car, finding a place to live in, etc.  Our app is easy to use and it can be displayed in other languages for easy access and peace of mind so you know youâ€™re contacting the right agent. 

You can :
  - Log in with Google, Facebook, Twitter or make a new Account
  - Find your Agent
  - Find a home 
  - Find a educational system/ learn English
  - Place to live
  - Open bank accounts
  - Find a vehicle
  - Potentially find a job
